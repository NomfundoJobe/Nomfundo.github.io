        <h2>Projects üîç</h2>
        <p>Below are the projects I have been involved in since starting my journey in data science:</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>1. CO2 Emissions Prediction in Agri-Food Sector üå±</h3>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>In this project, undertaken by me and my team members from the course, we aimed to analyze and predict CO2 emissions from the agri-food sector. We collaborated with stakeholders, including policymakers, agricultural businesses, and environmental organizations, to understand the impact of agricultural activities on climate change and suggest sustainable practices.</p>
            <h4>Data and Methodology</h4>
            <p>We utilized data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Our approach involved exploring a comprehensive dataset focusing on various emission sources, and we employed regression analysis to predict temperature variations.</p>
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <p>Our analysis provided actionable insights into how different agricultural activities contribute to CO2 emissions and identified areas where improvements can be made for greater sustainability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>2. Analysis of Seasonal Price Variations in Vegetables ü•¶</h3>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>In this project, conducted with my course team, we explored the factors influencing seasonal price variations in vegetables. We focused on understanding the economic principles of supply and demand and the impact of weather and other variables on pricing patterns.</p>
            <h4>Data and Methodology</h4>
            <p>We analyzed data on vegetable prices, examining how seasonal changes, weather conditions, transportation costs, and consumer preferences affect pricing. Our study also considered the implications of climate change on agricultural patterns.</p>
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <p>Our project identified critical factors such as unseasonable weather and transportation costs that significantly influence vegetable prices and highlighted the growing unpredictability in agricultural patterns due to climate change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>3. News Article Classification Using Machine Learning üì∞</h3>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>In this project, undertaken with my team, we developed a machine learning model to classify news articles into categories like Business, Technology, Sports, Education, and Entertainment. The goal was to assist news organizations and readers in efficiently organizing and accessing news content.</p>
            <h4>Data and Methodology</h4>
            <p>We collected a diverse set of news articles and labeled them according to predefined categories. We tested various machine learning algorithms to achieve high classification accuracy and deployed the final model using Streamlit to create a user-friendly web application.</p>
            <h4>Key Findings</h4>
            <p>The deployed model significantly improved the consistency and reliability of news categorization. The Streamlit app enabled real-time classification, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.</p>
